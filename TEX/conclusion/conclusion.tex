In this project a have created a generalized closed transaction model. Agents and the amount of wealth that is traded is randomly selected. A saving term was implemented which turned out to be positive for must agent. Different probability terms were introduced to the model. \todo{MIKAEL, skriv tre setninger om hoved essensen av hva du skrev i resultdelen.}

For future work one should try to make the trade ratio time dependent. The denominator in the trade ratio becomes larger over time, but a more realistic model would make the agents only care about the last part of the transaction they did. The effect of taxing or universal basic income would also be interesting to see, but this was to much work for this project.
