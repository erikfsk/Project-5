\abstract{I this project a model of a financial marked is build up from the basics, and follows two papers written on financial models. Three additional different levels of complexity is added to the system to expand the model. First the system only consists of agents that has to trade with each other. The resulting plots from this model is then compared to Pareto's law to verify the models basics. Then a savings term is introduced and several different savings factors are compared to make a comment on how saving influences the money distribution. Then a probability is added to the transaction stage. Here people with a similar amount of money are more willing to do a transaction. A scaling power factor is introduced and varied to influence to what extend the similarity in wealth influences the probability to trade. Here the results are commented and compared to Pareto's law. Finally a trust term is included in the probability term. This term increases the probability of making a transaction if the agents has previously done transactions. This term also has a scaling power factor which is varied to compare the influence of this term on the final wealth distribution. Lastly a modification is done to one of the scaling factors compared to the one in the papers followed in this project.}
